The Airline Reservation System is a relational database project developed using SQL to manage airline operations such as flight scheduling, customer booking, and ticketing.
This project demonstrates the efficient use of SQL queries, table design, constraints, and relationships to simulate a working airline booking system.
The system is built around core entities such as Flights, Customers, Bookings, and Tickets, linked using primary and foreign keys.
It uses features like AUTO_INCREMENT, ENUM types, JOIN operations, views, and stored procedures to manage and retrieve data effectively
